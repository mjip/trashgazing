# Trashgazing
Main fork is https://github.com/pseudo-apt/trashgazing

Web app that generates a projection of space debris coordinates from space-track.com.
Based on current position (defaults to downtown Montreal), it will grab all coordinates
of near- and medium-earth space debris (roughly ~30,000 at time of creation) and plot
onto a circle based on compass coordinates. So, if you were to lie on your back, you 
would be able to view trash constellations and trash dwarf planets and trash asteroids
in realtime. 

Written in Python/JS/WebGL for the 48 hour NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2018.
